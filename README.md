Project 4 Overview For project #4:

I built this project to be a remake of a website for a gym that I attend. The original website doesn't have much functionality but it is more for directing people to the gym. 

In my design I wanted the website to be an area where people can go to see updates to the gyms schedule and annoucements. I also wanted an area where the owners/coaches could log in and easily make these changes via a gui. expansion plans are to add an area where members can go in and log their goals and progress towards those goals and see that progress in a chart. 

A further expansion will be to add an area specifically for the jiujitsu members and have access to my project 2 which is a technique tracker for jiujitsu.
